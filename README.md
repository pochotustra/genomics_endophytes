Scripts to analyse the genomes of seven endophytic enterobacterial genomes
This repository contains supplementary information of the paper "Whole-genome comparative analysis of virulence genes 
unveils similarities and differences between endophytes and other symbiotic bacteria". Supplementary material provides
codes used for quality analysis in three assembly pipelines, namely: a5, SOAPdenovo and Velvet.
It also contains scripts that were coupled to the OrthoMCL pipeline in order to parse orthologous genes from the genomes
compared and assign functions to those genes in the depicted "core genomes".
Finally, a last script provides information of how presence and absence maps were constructed based on six RAST categories
